Optimization 
	find solution -> optimize

LLD 
	- code
		- Avoid unnecessary await as it makes the code wait i.e keep it in execution phase 
		- Complexity
		- Parallelism and concurrency

		* Storage optimization
		* Importing a package in the block it is used
		* Use of Promises/async and parralelism
		

	- query
		* fetch only the required fileds
		* Use of indexes for frequently used data,  
		* materialized views for data that is not modified frequently.
		* Subquery execution is usd for optimization.

		- Nosql
			* avoid relational operations
			* Indexing
			* Efficient use of flow of execution of aggregation pipeline. 
		



HLD: Any exernal tool that optimizes the performance comes under high level optimization
	- Redis
	  * provides different datatypes 

	- Elastic search 
	- Infrastructure


Response time optimization 




Concurrency - Single thread is switching between multiple tasks to execute task asynchronously. Concurrency in nodejs is achieve using async await
Parellelism - Two tasks are performed independently simultaneously. Multiple threads are required to use parallelism. To achieve parallelism in nodejs using modules. e.g child_process.


Sharding is a part of scaling
