1. Headers 
2. CORS - allowing all domains i.e using * is a bad practice 
4. base64 
5. What does bearer mean in bearer token? 
6. Where does request origins from is also mentioned in headers?
7. Read about cookie based authentication
8. session based authentication
9. headers are useful for - cors, cookie in headers

Key points:
1. In basic auth username and password are sent in headers which are encoded using basic 64 encoding
2. Browser storage management - cookie, local, session , index
3. local storage, session storage and cookie are all domain specific
	- cookie will always expire
	- session storage last for session (i.e as long as the tabs are open)
	- local storage lasts unless deleted manually

4. Respone header is different from request header as it has status code


Doubts:
1. when a key is passed as query param why is not it visible in the url
2. Difference between bearer token and jwt bearer
