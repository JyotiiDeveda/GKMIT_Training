Redis
1. cache find mechanism in redis has O(1) complexity as it uses hash map
2. It stores string and boolean values
3. different ways to save data in redis - set, hash, map
	- data is stored as key value pairs in hash
4. Data is stored in memory that is in ram
5. Redis does not have database name it works with indexes like first db in redis is [0], then [1] and so on.

Key naming convention 
	Syntax: "<resourcename>:<variable>"
	system variable - "system:maxLimit"

	e.g
	"user_id:account:explore": "[{     }]"
	"user_id:account:profile" "[    ]"
	"user_id:account:view_stories": "[ ]"
	: is the delimeter

redis provides modules	


To access data
1. 	Read from cache <-> read from DB
	* this is generally used
	- when data is requested first check in cache
	- if not present chcek in DB access it
	- save it to cache  
	- access from cache in later calls


2. Read from DB <-> rad from cache
	* this approach is used by developers to execute script once



To write data
1. Write in cache -> write in DB
	- used when number of post request is very large
	- when saving data from cache to db, queue mechanism is used where data is saved in batches(each queue index has a batch of data) from cache to database in 


2. Write in DB -> write in cache


* TTL can be set dynamically for different caches


Doubts -
how does transaction affect performance?


Case study

Tasks-
1. Create leaderboard using redis
2. Consider nearby geolocation and find the shortest distance locations
